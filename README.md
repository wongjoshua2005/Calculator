# Calculator

This project aims to create a basic working calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 


Reflection: This project definitely did take a lot of time to work on.
One of my biggest mistakes was not planning enough to include the extra
credit work because I should have done that. Consequently, I cannot do
the keyboard support. Overall, the project was very eye opening. I realized
that I need to work better on planning things out and improve my coding in
JavaScript. I will definitely be re reading back on how to write clean code,
and improve my planning next time. I cannot wait to improve my programming
skills and start making impactful projects to add onto my resume. :)
